<h4><a id="faq" class="help" shape="rect">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</a></h4>
<p class="help"><b>What is the Newspaper Directory?</b></p>
<br/>
<p class="help">The Newspaper Title Directory is derived from the library catalog records created by state institutions during the NEH-sponsored United States Newspaper Program (http://www.neh.gov/projects/usnp.html), 1980-2007. This program funded state-level projects to locate, describe (catalog), and selectively preserve (via treatment and microfilm) historic newspaper collections in that state, published from 1690 to the present. Under this program, each institution created machine-readable cataloging (MARC) via the Cooperative ONline SERials Program (CONSER) for its state collections, contributing bibliographic descriptions and library holdings information to the Newspaper Union List, hosted by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC). This data, approximately 140,000 bibliographic title entries and 900,000 separate library holdings records, was acquired and converted to MARCXML format for use in the Chronicling America Newspaper Title Directory.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help"><b>Why are there pages from only certain states?</b></p>
<br/>
<p class="help">Chronicling America is part of a phased project called the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP). This program, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanties (NEH), awards money to public newspaper archives in each state to digitize and deliver historic newspaper content to the Library of Congress for inclusion in Chronicling America. Listed below are the state and territories currently participating in the program and the date range for content they will provide*. Eventually, the NEH will fund awards in every state and territory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arizona, 1880-1922</li>
<li>California, 1880-1910</li>
<li>Florida, 1900-1910</li>
<li>Hawaii, 1880-1922</li>
<li>Kentucky, 1880-1910</li>
<li>Minnesota, 1880-1910</li>
<li>Missouri, 1880-1922</li>
<li>Nebraska, 1880-1910</li>
<li>New York, 1880-1910</li>
<li>Ohio, 1880-1922</li>
<li>Pennsylvania, 1880-1922</li>
<li>Texas, 1880-1910</li>
<li>Utah, 1880-1910</li>
<li>Virginia , 1880-1910</li>
<li>Washington, 1880-1922</li>
</ul>
<p>- In addition, the Library of Congress contributes digitized content from Washington, DC (1880-1910) and other significant material.</p>
<br/>
<p>*Note: All dates listed may not be available at this time, but content representing these states and time periods is scheduled to be added in future quarterly updates.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help"><b>When will more pages be available?</b></p>
<br/>
<p class="help">Chronicling America is updated on a quarterly basis with additional content received from awardees. Additional newspaper page content will be created by NEH awardees over the course of 2-year awards and added over time to Chronicling America by LC. NEH will host an NDNP annual award competition, gradually increasing the content time period and the geographic representation through additional awards.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help"><b>Why does the View Text link on the full Page screen show misspellings and badly-formed words?</b></p>
<br/>
<p class="help">The View Text option in Chronicling America displays machine-generated text that is produced by Optical Character Recognition software. Optical character recognition (OCR) is a fully automated process that converts the visual image of numbers and letters into computer-readable numbers and letters. Computer software can then search the OCR-generated text for words, phrases, numbers, or other characters. However, OCR is not 100 percent accurate, and, particularly if the original item has extraneous markings on the page, unusual text styles, or very small fonts, the searchable text OCR generates will contain errors that cannot be corrected by automated means.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help">Although errors in the process are unavoidable, OCR is still a powerful tool for making text-based items accessible to searching. For example, important concept words often appear more than once within an article. Therefore, if OCR misreads one instance of a key word in a passage, but correctly reads the second instance, the passage will still be found in a full-text search.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help"><b>Why are there variant spellings of counties and cities in the Newspaper Directory Search?</b></p>
<br/>
<p class="help">The Newspaper Directory browsing for county and city are loaded dynamically from the Chronicling America directory records. Misspellings in place names are the result of typographical errors in the CONSER records and can only be corrected in the original CONSER records hosted by OCLC WorldCat. Please contact a CONSER member <a href="http://www.loc.gov/acq/conser/conmembs.html" shape="rect">(http://www.loc.gov/acq/conser/conmembs.html)</a> with library holdings of that title to request cataloging improvements to these records.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help"><b>Why do diacritics and non-English language characters sometimes appear "Romanized" or not in their original alphabets?</b></p>
<br/>
<p class="help">The Newspaper Directory provides access to newspaper title records cataloged according to standard bibliographic rules. Until recently, most non-English language characters were difficult to represent in library records and so Romanization - or standard rules for transliterating other alphabets to the Roman alphabet - was used to convey phonetic pronounciations of non-English words.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help"><b>I've discovered a Directory newspaper title record in need of updating or editing, what should I do?</b></p>
<br/>
<p class="help">Newspaper title information included in Chronicling America is downloaded at regular intervals from the CONSER (Cooperative Online Serials Cataloging) databases. In order to update or edit bibliographic records for Chronicling America, please contact a CONSER member <a href="http://www.loc.gov/acq/conser/conmembs.html" shape="rect">(http://www.loc.gov/acq/conser/conmembs.html)</a> with library holdings of that title to request cataloging improvements to these records.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help"><b>How do I cite or reference newspaper Directory records and pages for re-use (e.g., in a Web site or other electronic display) or reference (e.g., in a bibliography or journal article) external to Chronicling America?</b></p>
<br/>
<p class="help">Chronicling America supports persistent links to
  newspaper Directory records and pages by providing a predictable
  URL, displayed in the descriptive information for that object. Using
  the proposed <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/draft-gregorio-uritemplate-00.html" onmouseup="return linkDisclaimer.rewriteAnchor(this);" shape="rect">URI Template</a> syntax the links will use the pattern: 
</p>
<ul class="help"><li>http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/{lccn}/{date}/ed-{edition}/seq-{image sequence}</li></ul>

<p class="help">
  Where:
</p>
<ul class="help"><li><i>lccn</i> is the # Library of Congress Control Number for the newspaper</li><li><i>date</i> is the date of the issue, specified as yyyy-mm-dd (e.g. 1902-01-30)</li><li><i>edition</i> is the edition number for that date (e.g. 1)</li><li><i>seq</i> is the image sequence number (e.g. 23) for that issue.</li></ul>

<p class="help">
  For example: 
</p>
  
<ul class="help"><li>http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749/1903-01-08/ed-1/seq-2</li></ul>

<h4><a id="general_searching" class="help" shape="rect"><i>General Searching in Chronicling America</i></a></h4>
<p class="help">Results listed first are most likely to be relevant to your search. Results will appear higher in the list when they contain
</p>
<ul class="help"><li>more of your search terms;</li><li>repeated search terms;</li><li>search terms that occur near each other;</li></ul>

<p class="help">Your searches will yield better results if you keep the following points in mind:
</p>
<ul class="help"><li>Common words such as <b>and</b>, <b>not</b>, and <b>the</b> are ignored by the search engine.</li><li>Case of letters is ignored. For example, <b>Civil</b> and <b>civil</b> are treated the same.</li><li>Diacritic characters (accent marks, in non-English text) and other special characters produce inaccurate results, so plain (unaccented) letters should be substituted for letters with diacritics.</li></ul>
<h4><a id="search_and_browsing_tips" class="help" shape="rect"><i>Search and Browsing Tips</i></a></h4>
<p>Many browsers have the capability of tabbed browsing, which opens a new pane in the current window, either in the background or the foreground. Users of Chronicling America have reported this as a useful method of navigating through search results- bringing up each result in a new tab. This may be accomplished by clicking with the right-hand mouse button (for Mac, hold down the Command key) and selecting "Open Link in New Tab." </p>
<p>Search results are displayed on a page that can easily be bookmarked or navigated to via the "Back" button on the browser. Every page in the Chronicling America application can be bookmarked, but only the addresses containing newspaper pages should be treated as canonical for purposes of citations and long-term referrals These addresses are displayed in the address bar of the browser, and no special treatment is required for adding them to a citation database. (Select the "Persistent Link" URL displayed on each newspaper page view to store the link without search text highlighted.)</p>
<p class="help"><b>Search for a Phrase</b></p>
<p class="help">Put quotation marks around the phrase you are searching.</p>
<p class="help">When searching for a phrase, enter the words in the order they are most likely to occur.</p>
<p class="help">The order of search words does not affect the scope of the search results, but it will affect the order of their display.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help"><b>Too Many Results</b> - If a search generates too many results, try using more specific terms.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help"><b>Too Few Results</b>  - If a search generates too few results, try alternate terms or broader subjects.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help">Because language changes, be sure to use search terms used at the time the materials were created, even if those terms are now obsolete. For example, the following historic terms will produce more results than their modern-day counterparts: </p>
<table class="help" border="1" frame="box"><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Modern Usage vs. Historic Usage comparison table</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><b>Modern Usage</b></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><b>Historic Usage</b></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">gas, service station</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">filling station</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">African American</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Afro American, Negro</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">voting rights</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">suffrage</td></tr></table>
<br/>
<p class="help">Use the names of towns, landmarks, bridges, buildings, and other geographic features that were current when the materials you are searching were created.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help">Matching an exact phrase can be useful for searching place names or when common words have a particular sense used in combination.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help">For example, the term "normal school" was used in the early twentieth century to describe schools for training teachers. Searching for the exact phrase may eliminate results containing the words "normal" and "school" in unrelated ways.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help">Note: Some very common words, such as and, of, the, a, and to, are ignored even when matching exact phrases.</p>
<br/>

<h4><a id="searching_directory" class="help" shape="rect"><i>Searching the Newspaper Directory</i></a></h4>
<p class="help">First, review the <b>General Searching</b> information above. The <i>Chronicling America</i> Newspaper Directory contains more than 139,000 serial title records for historic newspapers published in the United States from 1690 to the present. Also included are over 900,000 Local Data Records indicating which libraries hold which copies and in what form. These records are created and edited by members of the Cooperative Online Serials (CONSER) cataloging program and currently hosted in the OCLC WorldCat bibliographic catalog. A copy of these records has been included in <i>Chronicling America</i>. Updated CONSER records will be added to <i>Chronicling America</i> at regular intervals. </p>
<br/>
<p class="help">Users can search the Newspaper Directory in a variety of ways, utilizing the data encoded by CONSER catalogers. Search results rely on the unedited CONSER data as it was created in the MARC format.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help">Keyword searching will match words that appear in most narrative fields, including newspaper history essays associated with each digitized title. For example, matching an exact phrase, using quotes around the words in the Keyword field, can also be useful if you know a standard Library of Congress subject term, such as "Anarchism--Newspapers" or "penny papers".</p>
<br/>
<p class="help">For the Keyword search box, entering multiple terms will automatically search for matches with all terms (operator = AND).</p>
<br/>
<p class="help">You can limit your search for Newspapers in the Directory by a variety of search options. For some users, knowing the origin of these options will help in precise searching. These options rely on specific MARC fields in the title and local data records, as follows:</p>

<p class="help">All pages are digitally scanned - primarily from microfilm, described, and automatically processed for full-text searching through a process called Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This text is organized in normal reading order (by column) and left uncorrected. Search strategies may take this into consideration.</p>
<br/>
<p class="help">One helpful way to use the full-text search feature is to enter a term or phrase containing many words that characterize the topic you wish to investigate. A full-text search will then retrieve pages with similar passages, displaying small page images with red highlights visible representing the occurrence of searched terms. This visual interface allows for quick review of full pages and search terms to determine the most useful results to view at full-size. An alternate results list is available through the List View, which will display descriptive textual links to individual pages, where search terms will be highlighted in red wherever they occur on the page. </p>
