Open ONI In Docker
===============

The short answer:

- Start services with `docker-compose up`
- Stop them with CTRL+C
- Remove containers with `docker-compose down`
- Run commands with exec, e.g.: `docker-compose exec web /load_batch.sh foo`

See [our Open ONI docker
page](https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/wiki/Docker) on the wiki
for more detailed Docker instructions.
